            <h3>First Paragraph</h3>
            <p id="para1">
                If you explain the the definition of L.Robinson then you will found that life of human being are depend
                on main three character such as unlimited scarcity, limited resources and on alternative usable
                resources. according to L.Rabinson's definition the basic speciality of human life are extreme needs,
                limited resources and alternate usable resources By analysing Robin's definition it may be observed that
                it has been established on the three basic characteristics of human being i.e. unlimited scarcity
                ,limited wealth & alternative usable wealth. In the acceptability related explanations of econometrics
                models of economics,mathematical and statistical methods are applied. as this is not the good technique
                to do work but eventually it will recognizeall of that finally Data of econometrics economic models are
                used in mathematical and statistical methods of associated analyses. Marginal economic theory studies
                how a consumer tries to attain maximum satisfaction taking income and wealth as constraints. Consumers
                try to reach to the point of more satisfaction considering income and resources of the marginal economic
                theory as a matter of obstacles,which is analyzed. If resources are reused in case of consumers or other
                representatives the difference between production and scarcity would come down, like idle time in case
                of income, private goods in place of public goods, present consumption for future consumption. It is
                generally related to Cambridge University and works of Robinson. It is generally associated with the
                works of Cambridge University and Joan Robinson. good way to start Welfare Definition Definition of
                welfare Many economists cited examples of transformation from 'assumed condition' to observation based
                concept which are as below: Many economist have given the examples of change from importance of
                observation from permissible condition, they are as down below: Many economists have given the example
                of the idea of changing from hypothetical terms to observational terms,which are as follows: Some
                economists such as John Stuart Mill or Leon Walras mention that the wealth production cannot be bind
                with its distribution. Some economists like John Stuart Mill or Leon Walras mentions that the production
                of wealth cannot be limited to its distribution Some economists like John Stuart Mill or Leon Wallace
                stated that production of wealth can't be tied with its distribution. As example we can say that, in the
                economics of the authorization process, equal right process or the process of economics the higher class
                in the society, their capabilities are applied without any screening. imagination and celebration was
                made that time evry one was very happy with the result of that win in that time. It can be said as an
                example that in the economic systems of absolute ownership,equal rights or higher class of the
                society,it is applied without scrutinizing their competency.

                In the Domain name system, the job of assigning the domain names and connecting them to the IP addresses
                is divided between some authoritative Name Servers In the domain name system, the work of giving the
                different domain names and connecting them to the IP addresses are distributed among some authoritative
                name servers. Domain Name System distributes the task of assignment of domain names and their
                identification with IP addresses among a few authoritative name server. In Domain Name System, the
                responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to IP addresses are distributed to some
                authoritative name servers. Even in the present time there is also a host file in every modern operating
                system too through which the users can connect the different names (like, www.example.net) with the IP
                addresses (like, 208.77.188.166) even without the help of DNS. At present also most of the operating
                system has a host file with the help of which the user without the help of the DNS can connect various
                names (like www.example.com) with the ip address (208.77.188.166). Presently in all modern system there
                is a host file by using that without taking any help from DNS user can contact with different IP
                address(like WWW.example.net IP address of this is 208.77.188.166). today also most of the operating
                system uses a host file which can connect the names(eg. www.example.com) to the ip
                address(208.77.188.166) without the help of dns. In 1984 four student of Barkal - Doglas Tery, Mocker
                Painter, Devid Rigol and Sun Nion jho wrote the Version of Unix which was look after by Rafial
                Kajampabel. In 1984, four Berkeley students—Douglas Terry, Mark Painter, David Riggle and Songnian
                Zhou—wrote the first UNIX implementation which was later supervised by Ralph Campbel. In 1984, four
                Berkeley students - Douglas Terry, Mark Painter, David Riggle, and Songnian Zhou wrote the first version
                of Unix which Ralph Campbell used to maintain later on. In year 1984 four student -Doglas tery,Mark
                Painter,David Rigal,and Songniyan Jhuo first write Unix, later Ryalf Campbell took care of it. The
